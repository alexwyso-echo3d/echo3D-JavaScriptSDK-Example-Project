# echo3D-JavaScriptSDK-Example-Project
This example project utilizes the echo3D JavaScript SDK to allow users to interact with the echo3D API via JavaScript code.
The SDK can be downloaded [here](https://storage.echo3d.com/JS/Echo3DApi.zip).

## Setup and Run

6. Copy your API key from the top of the console and paste it into the application.
